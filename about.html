                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Sacred Heart Parish, Cabramatta – a parish community immersed in history, enriched by
                    diversity, and alive in faith. Located in the heart of South-West Sydney, Sacred Heart Cabramatta
                    has been a spiritual home for people of all backgrounds, united by a common mission to share God’s
                    love and mercy with our community.<br><br>
                    Our Parish was built by the early visionaries who dreamed of a community where faith could flourish,
                    and countless families have contributed their time, efforts, and resources to nurture and sustain
                    the Parish community throughout the years. For over 75 years, our Parish has been a beacon of hope,
                    a sanctuary in times of need, and a source of charity for all who have walked through its
                    doors.<br><br>
                    Our Parish Priest, Fr Remy Lam Bui, supported by Fr John Pham and the Sisters of Our Lady of the
                    Southern Cross continues the exemplary history of service and generosity in Cabramatta, bringing
                    God’s love and mercy to the community.

                        <h3>Our Early Beginnings: Faith in Simplicity</h3>
                        <p class="content">The story of Sacred Heart Parish begins in September 1919, when the first
                            Catholic church in Cabramatta was established using a humble Australian Army Hut purchased
                            by His Grace Archbishop Kelly. Mass was celebrated by priests from Liverpool Parish, and
                            during the week, the Sisters of Charity travelled by train to use the hut as a classroom for
                            local children. On weekends, parishioners transformed the space for Sunday Mass.

                        <h3>Becoming a Parish: A Post-War Community</h3>
                        <p class="content">Following the tremendous growth in the region after World War II, Cabramatta
                            was officially inaugurated as a parish on 1 February 1949. The first Parish Priest, Fr
                            Michael Kiely, oversaw the early development of the parish. A cottage on Bartley Street was
                            acquired in 1950, and a brick presbytery was built in 1952 on Park Road. This allowed the
                            Sisters of Charity to move into community and begin a more permanent presence.
                        </p>

                    <div class="HSlide">
                        <h3>Migration and Multicultural Growth</h3>
                        <p class="content">Sacred Heart Parish has been uniquely shaped by successive waves of
                            migration. Beginning in 1946, displaced people fleeing the devastation of war — primarily
                            from Poland, Italy, Germany, and Yugoslavia — found a new spiritual home in Cabramatta.
                            These European migrants formed the foundation of a faith-filled and hard-working
                            community.<br><br>
                            In the 1950s and 1960s, migrants from the United Kingdom further enriched parish life. In
                            response to the community’s growth, local men formed a “Men’s Club” in 1957, contributing
                            voluntary labour to build and maintain parish facilities.<br><br>
                            Under Fr Darcy O’Keefe, who became the second Parish Priest in 1959, parish infrastructure
                            expanded dramatically. A Canvass Committee was formed to raise funds through a planned
                            giving scheme, while also welcoming new parishioners. Their efforts led to the construction
                            of a new church, which was blessed on Christmas Eve 1961, with the first Mass celebrated by
                            Cardinal Gilroy. The committee continued to raise funds for the acquisition of school
                            grounds, building of a parish hall, school canteen, administrative block, and
                            classrooms.<br><br>
                            The 1980s and 1990s brought a profound transformation, as refugees and migrants from
                            Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand arrived in large numbers. Their presence reinvigorated
                            the parish, leading to the introduction of Vietnamese-language liturgies, devotions, and new
                            ministries. The Southeast Asian heritage continues to be central to Sacred Heart's cultural
                            identity today.

                        <h3>Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School</h3>
                        <p class="content">Our connection to Catholic education remains a proud part of our parish
                            heritage. Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School opened in January 1935 with an enrolment of
                            75 children. Since then, the school has grown alongside the parish, offering students an
                            education grounded in faith, sacraments, and a sense of community. Close collaboration
                            between parish and school continues today through shared liturgies, sacramental programs,
                            and pastoral care.

                            Inspired by the motto of St Mary MacKillop, “Never see a need without doing something about
                            it”, Sacred Heart Parish has a long and proud tradition of social outreach. For many decades
                            the Parish operated the local St Vincent de Paul Society outreach supporting individuals and
                            families in need through food assistance, home visits, and emergency relief. We have a
                            generous team of catechists reaching out to children in our local state schools and bringing
                            the Good News to their lives.

                            Over the decades, Sacred Heart Parish has been blessed with visionary leadership. Fr

                            In 1974, Fr Patrick McAuliffe became the third Parish Priest who served as Parish Priest for
                            over 40 years. He guided the parish through immense demographic changes and into the 21st
                            century, always encouraging with his hallmark phrase: “Not a worry in the world.”
