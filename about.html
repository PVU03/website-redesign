                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>The name “Cabramatta” is Aboriginal itself, “Cabra” meaning a white grub and “Matta” meaning
                    place.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sacred Heart Cabramatta has always been a multicultural parish from the influx of migrants and
                    refugees in 1946 all the way to the 1990s. The diverse backgrounds of past and present parishioners
                    at Sacred Heart Cabramatta has always brought with it the Christian values of love, respect and
                    tolerance. Together we have formed a true Parish Family.

                        <h3>1949 - 1959</h3>
                        <p class="content">The first Catholic church at Cabramatta was an Australian Army hut placed
                            in Park Road in 1919, with Fr Walsh from Liverpool coming here to officiate Holy
                            Mass. When WWII came to an end on 1st February 1949, Cabramatta became its own
                            parish under the patronage of the Sacred Heart. The buildings were used as
                            classrooms on weekdays and as the Parish church on weekends. Our first Parish Priest
                            was Fr Michael Joseph Kiely, who served Cabramatta from 1949 -1959 with Fr
                            Daniel McAuliffe the first Assistant Priest, joining the parish in August 1956.
                            <br><br>
                            Sacred Heart School has always been an integral part of the Parish. The Sisters of
                            Charity resided at St Mary’s convent in Liverpool and travelled daily by train to
                            Cabramatta. When the new Presbytery was built on Park Road in 1953, Fr Kiely moved
                            out of the cottage in Bartley Street where he had been living and this then became the
                            first convent. The Sisters no longer had to travel from Liverpool every day.
                            <br><br>
                            The Polish Community:
                            Post war migration of the early 1950’s brought about 700 Polish refugees to Cabramatta and
                            its surrounding districts by 1956. At first, the spiritual needs of these predominantly
                            Catholic people were met on an ad-hoc basis by visiting priests.

                            A regular monthly Sunday Mass for the Polish community was inaugurated at Sacred Heart
                            towards the end of 1952 when Fr Stanislaw Mika CSSR and Fr Arciszewski CM began to celebrate
                            the 11am Polish Mass. Fr Sadok Mackowiak OP was the first permanent chaplain and remained so
                            for seven years.
                        </p>

                        <h3>1959 - 1969</h3>
                        <p class="content">In 1959, Fr Kiely left Cabramatta and Fr Darcy O’Keeffe was appointed as the
                            second Parish Priest. He arrived in March 1959. Within twelve months, Fr O’Keeffe addressed
                            the parishioners on the need for a new church and for new methods of financing it, which
                            included the Planned Giving Scheme (Weekly Envelopes). Fr O’Keeffe was considered the
                            driving force behind so much of the construction and financial practices of the Parish. He
                            built onto the pioneering work of Father Kiely and the early pioneers and has left his mark
                            on the tremendous growth and development of our Parish.
                            <br><br>
                            Approval from Archdiocese of Sydney to proceed with the construction of the new church using
                            the Cruciform design. In early 1961 the Army Hut (Church) was moved to the rear of the
                            church grounds (where the present Canteen & learning area is situated) and work commenced on
                            the new church.
                            <br><br>
                            With the success of the Planned Giving Scheme, it was decided to continue with the Scheme
                            and to build a new Convent at Park Road for the sisters to live in. This was opened in 1963.
                            <br>
                            Agreement was reached by the parishioners to continue with the fund raising through the
                            Weekly Envelopes and to seal the previously dirt playground, to construct a Parish Hall, a
                            School Canteen, Administration Block and add classrooms as required.

                        <p class="content">In September 1974, Fr O’Keeffe was appointed to Balgowlah Parish. He managed
                            to receive approval from Cardinal Gilroy for an extension to the Presbytery before leaving.
                            The Saint Vincent De Paul shop was added to the side of the Presbytery. Fr Patrick McAuliffe
                            arrived at Cabramatta on 1st October 1974 and became our third Parish Priest.

                            <b>25th Anniversary (1974)</b>
                            Our Parish celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 1974, which included a big mass that welcomed
                            all cultures and nationalities, memorabilia inside the Church, and many festivities
                            throughout the day.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>The Vietnamese Community:</b>
                            Fr John Tran Quang Thien approached Fr McAuliffe for permission to have a Mass in Vietnamese
                            held here at Cabramatta each week. Fr McAuliffe agreed and extended a warm welcome to the
                            Vietnamese people. The first Vietnamese Mass here was on the 20th June 1982 at 4pm.
                            <br><br>
                            The Polish community continued to grow alongside with the Church. With its use of the new
                            church, the Polish readily applied themselves to church cleaning duties after their first
                            Friday Masses. Perhaps the most momentous and memorable visit by a Polish church dignitary
                            to Cabramatta has been that of Cardinal Karol Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II) in February 1973.
                            <br><br>
                            The Spanish Community: The first Spanish Mass at Cabramatta was celebrated by Fr Gines Ortin
                            1974. It continued for a while however with the Spanish numbers dwindling, they continued to
                            have Mass at Fairfield parish.
                            <br><br>
                            The Vietnamese Community: In 1977, Asians (Vietnamese, Chinese, Laotian, Thai, Malaysian and
                            Cambodian) arrived in Cabramatta after the end of the Vietnam War. Visiting priests often
                            came to hostels to say Mass, however many attended the English Masses in order to received
                            Holy Communion. It was not until 1982 that the first Vietnamese Mass was said at Cabramatta.
                            <br><br>
                            The Italian Community: Father Angelo Buffalo celebrated the first Italian mass at Sacred
                            Heart, Cabramatta, in 1977. This 7:30am Sunday Mass was the start to the building of the
                            Italian community. The Italian community in Cabramatta was born, coming together with a
                            common purpose to reinvigorate the faith for all the elderly, who perhaps had lost touch as
                            a result of the language barriers and to introduce the young to the Italian traditions and
                            to participate in the work of the Sacred Heart Parish. There was a great willingness of many
                            lay people to participate, in particular the youth, who became the go-between that
                            facilitated the breaking of the cultural barriers that existed.

                        <p class="content">Fr Paul Finucan was the first Cabramatta parishioner to be ordained as a
                            priest on 22nd August 1981. He celebrated his first mass at Cabramatta with his family and
                            the parish community.
                            <br><br>
                            In 1984, our Church underwent renovations following changes to Catholic worship and the
                            celebration of mass post Vatican II. This included the removal of altar rails, relocation of
                            the altar and having priests now face the congregation.
                            <br><br>
                            The Sisters of Charity continued to serve in our school and parish, with Sister Margaret
                            Case joining the Parish Pastoral team in 1980 and Sister Jean Montgomery in 1985. Sister
                            Enid Doherty was principal of the school from 1979 to 1985, followed by Sister Margaret
                            Valentine in 1986. After 50 years, Sacred Heart School got its first lay Principal with the
                            appointment of Mrs Shirley Jackson from 1988-1996, followed by Mrs Sybil Dickens.
                            <br><br>
                            The St Vincent De Paul’s Society had volunteers doing 20 – 30 home visits per week, helping
                            with the influx of refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, South America and Poland. We were
                            blessed to have the support and guidance of a spiritual advisor Father Mac and the
                            assistance of the other parishioners. Over the years we have received generous support from
                            Sacred Heart Primary School, Mary MacKillop College and Patrician Brothers’ College, and the
                            anonymous benefactors of SVDP in Cabramatta.

                            <b>A Liturgy Committee</b> was one of the recommendations. This required interested
                            parishioners to
                            work closely with the clergy to develop our liturgical celebrations.<br>
                            Some of the developments have come about – rostering commentators and readers at weekend
                            Masses; intense planning for special occasions and masses; preparing notices; having
                            organists and choirs to participate through music and hymns; having PowerPoint presentations
                            and many more.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Lenten Group:</b> The Prayer Network Team which linked up people to pray for the renewal
                            of the
                            parish. The small groups began to gather in 1990; there were more groups meeting in 1991
                            growing to 23 by 1993.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Acolytes and Special Minister:</b> With the growth of the parish, the spiritual needs of
                            parishioners also increased and additional ministers were required to assist the priests. In
                            October 1978, Bishop Cremin installed the first acolytes into the Ministry of Acolyte at
                            Cabramatta and in 1990 Extraordinary Ministers were also introduced.
                            <br><br>
                            The Liturgy Team concentrated on making Sunday Masses, especially the 10am English mass, a
                            family celebration. To this day, the Sunday 10am mass is known as the ‘Children’s mass’,
                            with hymns being sung by the children’s choir.
                            <br><br>
                            Fr Martin Nicol ran the RCIA process in Cabramatta, where he gathered a small team of
                            catechists who were trained in the RCIA process. People who were interested in ﬁnding out
                            more about the Catholic Faith were invited to join.

                            In 1999, our Parish celebrated our Diamond Jubilee Anniversary.

                            In August 2005, we thanked the Sisters of Charity for serving our Parish from 1935 to 2005.
                            The Sacred Heart school motto “LEARN OF ME” came from the Sisters of Charity, and is still
                            adhered to in our school life and parish.
                            <br><br>
                            On 23rd July 2006, we celebrated Fr McAuliffe’s Golden Jubilee of his Ordination. 2 months
                            later, on the 30th September, we welcomed the Sisters of Our Lady of the Southern Cross into
                            our parish.

                        <p class="content">On the 17th June 2012, the Apostolic Nuncio to Australia, Archbishop Giuseppe
                            Lazzarotto, celebrated mass and blessed the two new shrines of The Holy Family and Saint
                            Mary Mackillop, which are on our parish grounds.
                            <br><br>
                            In 2016, Fr McAuliffe officially retired after 60 years of active ministry as a priest, 42
                            years of
                            which were in Cabramatta. He may have moved to Rosary Village, but he was always back to
                            help out when asked. He also continued his work at Mary MacKillop College for many years
                            into his ‘retirement’.
                            <br><br>
                            In January 2016, Archbishop Anthony Fisher appointed Fr Liem Duong as the administrator of
                            our Parish and officially installed as the fourth Parish Priest on the 18th December 2016.
                            During his leadership as our fourth Parish Priest, the parish held huge celebrations. Fr
                            Liem brought his creative vision to the Parish, expanding the decorations around the Church
                            and actively involving the community.
                            <br><br>
                            2016 was also the Year of Mercy, which featured a parish trip to St Mary's Cathedral. As a
                            Church, we celebrated this year with Parish Mission Week to close out the year from the 11th
                            to 20th of November. This week included a week full of retreats, talks and reflections.
                            <br><br>
                            In 2018, the family conference retreats and talks took place with parishioners able to
                            obtain a Papal blessing. The Christmas cribs also seemed to grow in size and reverence.

                        <h3>2019 - Now</h3>
                        <p class="content">
                            Our beloved friend and spiritual father, Fr McAuliffe, passed away on 24th April 2020. Due
                            to COVID-19, the parishioners were unable to attend the Pontifical Mass of Christian Burial
                            for Fr McAuliffe. The Parish celebrated Fr McAuliffe’s Mass of Remembrance on 24th April
                            2021. During his stewardship, Fr Mac ministered over an increasingly challenging and diverse
                            Parish and took it into the 21st century. We can all still hear his rallying cry of “Not a
                            worry in the world” and feel his impact on the lives of those he ministered to and
                            befriended. Fr Mac was very involved with our primary and high schools. He knew that the
                            future of our parish and the church was going to be the youth. The PCYC was another huge
                            part of his life, and he could be found there coaching the basketball or just having a chat
                            with the young people. May he rest in peace.
                            <br><br>
                            Fr Remy Son Lam Bui, our current Parish Priest, started his ministry in our parish on the
                            3rd September 2019. Fr Remy was officially installed as the fifth Parish Priest on 15th
                            December 2019. Fr Moses Tamale also joined as assistant parish priest from 2019 to 2022.
                            After Fr Moses, Fr Roberto Keryakos joined our Parish as Assistant Priest and served from
                            2022 to 2023. Archbishop Anthony Fisher appointed Fr Roberto as Assistant Priest at St
                            Mary’s Cathedral in late 2023, and Fr John Pham (current Assistant Priest) started in 2024.
                            <br><br>
                            COVID-19 was a shock to all but the closure of the church was unthinkable before this. On
                            the positive side, the parish was forced to get familiar with the digital age, with the
                            Sisters and the youth posting bulletins, notices and updates via the web and Facebook. Mass
                            from our homes became common and use of technology grew. As we came back to physical Mass,
                            phones were needed to ‘check in’. Fr Remy, Fr Moses Tamale and many volunteers assisted with
                            live-streaming masses on Youtube. Wow, what a growth spurt!
                            <br><br>
                            The Youth group continues to grow in the Parish through volunteering in altar serving,
                            reading, media or general running of events in the church. As of 2022, there is a Youth
                            Committee representative as part of the Parish Council, hosting monthly Adoration and Young
                            Adults group talk sessions, a youth choir that sings at Saturday 6pm masses and many other
                            events.
