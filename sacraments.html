                        <p>The Sacrament of Confirmation is the second of the three sacraments of Christian initiation.
                            Confirmation completes Baptism, by which in the laying on of hands and the anointing with
                            Chrism

                            We
                            are reminded of our participation in the ministry and mission of Jesus, and strengthened to

                        <p>The Sacrament of Confirmation consists of the renewal of baptismal promises and the laying on

                            hands and anointing with the oil of Chrism. The anointing of the candidate is a sign of
                            confirming the gift of the Spirit, and calling the candidates to use these gifts to become
                            involved in the life and mission of the community.

                                    Holy Spirit. The bishop anoints the candidate’s forehead with the Oil of Chrism,
                                    saying
                                    ‘Be sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit’.

                                <p>At the end of the rite, the bishop puts his hand on the side of the candidate’s face

                                    says ‘Peace be with you’ and the candidate replies with ‘And with your spirit’,
                                    symbolising the candidate’s place within the Church community.

                            wine
                            are transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ.

                        <h2>Penance</h2>
                        <p>The Sacrament of Penance is one of two sacraments of healing (the other being the Anointing
                            of
                            the Sick). Penance is a sacrament of forgiveness and celebrates God’s love and mercy towards
                            us.
                            It is about acknowledging and naming those times when we know we have done wrong, and then
                            making peace and restoring the relationships with those who have been affected by our poor
                            choices. The Sacrament of Penance is celebrated through the Rites of Reconciliation.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>What happens during Penance</b></p>
                        <p>Penance involves the individual acknowledging their sins and receiving the forgiveness of God
                            through the ministry of the priest.
                        </p>
                        <p>Through this process, a person is reconciled with the Church, renews his or her Baptism, and
                            continues to live as a disciple of Jesus.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Anointing of the Sick</h2>
                        <p>The Anointing of the Sick is administered to bring spiritual and even physical strength
                            during an
                            illness, especially near the time of death. It is most likely one of the last sacraments one
                            will receive. A sacrament is an outward sign established by Jesus Christ to confer inward
                            grace.
                            In more basic terms, it is a rite that is performed to convey God’s grace to the recipient,
                            through the power of the Holy Spirit.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Sacrament of Holy Orders creates a priest.</p>
                        <p>There’s a little more to it than that, of course. As the Catechism’s section on Holy Orders
                            says:
                            this “is the sacrament through which the mission entrusted by Christ to his apostles
                            continues
                            to be exercised in the Church until the end of time: thus it is the sacrament of apostolic
                            ministry. It includes three degrees” - the orders of bishop, priest, and deacon. (Catechism,
                            1536)
                        </p>

                        <h2>Becoming A Catholic</h2>
                        <p>The Catholic Church has a special way of initiating adults into the Catholic faith. It is
                            called the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA). It is a period of Christian
                            formation
                            offered to those seeking to become Catholic. The RCIA may also be referred to as the
                            Catechumenate, highlighting its roots in the Christian formation of the early Church. The
                            Rite
                            encompasses all aspects of the Christian life and includes an adaptation for children.
                        </p>
                        <p>The RCIA takes place within a parish community so you are able to share in the life of the
                            Church
                            expressed in a local faith community. It offers a way to grow in knowledge of Christ and the
                            Catholic faith in company with others on a similar journey.
                        </p>
