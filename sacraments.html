                    <h2>Baptism</h2>
                    <p>Through Baptism we are given the privilege of being part of our Catholic community. In Baptism we
                        are given a share in God’s life Baptism incorporates us into the Body of Christ. Through the
                        waters of Baptism we have been liberated from the slavery of sin in order to live life to the
                        full. The outpouring of the Spirit at baptism enables us to bring Christ to the World.

                                life-the new spiritual life that the baby or child is entering.

                    <h2>Confirmation</h2>
                    <p>The Sacrament of Confirmation is the second of the three sacraments of Christian initiation.
                        Confirmation completes Baptism, by which in the laying on of hands and the anointing with Chrism
                        Oil, which first happened at Baptism, we are confirmed with the fullness of the Holy Spirit. We
                        are reminded of our participation in the ministry and mission of Jesus, and strengthened to
                        follow Jesus more closely.
                    </p>
                    <p>Usually the bishop presides over this sacrament.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>What happens during the sacrament of Confirmation?</b></p>
                    <p>The Sacrament of Confirmation consists of the renewal of baptismal promises and the laying on of
                        hands and anointing with the oil of Chrism. The anointing of the candidate is a sign of
                        confirming the gift of the Spirit, and calling the candidates to use these gifts to become
                        involved in the life and mission of the community.
                    </p>

                    <p>THE SYMBOLIC GESTURES OF CONFIRMATION</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>The Laying On of Hands:</b></p>
                            <p>The bishop places his hands on the head of the candidates and prays for the gifts of the
                                Holy Spirit. This ritualises the connection to Baptism and the strengthening of the Holy
                                Spirit in our vocation to follow the way of Jesus.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Anointing with oil:</b></p>
                            <p>The anointing of the candidate at Confirmation recognises that they are sealed with the
                                Holy Spirit. The bishop anoints the candidate’s forehead with the Oil of Chrism, saying
                                ‘Be sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit’.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <p><b>The Sign of Peace:</b></p>
                            <p>At the end of the rite, the bishop puts his hand on the side of the candidate’s face and
                                says ‘Peace be with you’ and the candidate replies with ‘And with your spirit’,
                                symbolising the candidate’s place within the Church community.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>What do I need to do if I would like to have my child confirmed?</b></p>
                    <p>To start the process to be confirmed you will need to contact your local parish. We have
                        a <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> to help you contact our parish if you live in or near
                        Cabramatta. Other than
                        that, if you would like to confirm your child, please fill in this form.
                    </p>
                    <p>Parents are the first teachers of faith to their children and therefore are required to take part
                        in the parish preparation to enable them to understand the meaning of the sacrament and the
                        commitment they will make to support their child’s growth in faith and life.

                        <p><b>Confirmation Name</b></p>
                            <p>Choosing a Confirmation name has never been an official part of the sacrament, although
                                it has been a popular custom in many places.
                            </p>
                            <p>Our given names are a very important part of our identity. Parents put a lot of thought
                                into choosing a child’s name. It is appropriate for a candidate to confirm the name
                                given at Baptism.
                            </p>
                            <p>If a saint’s name is chosen, it should be a name of a saint that inspires the child.
                                Choosing a Confirmation name helps put us in contact with our greater Christian story.
                            </p>
                        <p><b>Who should I choose as a sponsor?</b></p>
                            <p>Confirmation is a reaffirmation of the promises made at Baptism, therefore the Church
                                recommends that a child’s godparent take on the role of sponsor for Confirmation.
                            </p>
                            <p>Sponsors should be: at least 16 years old, not the child’s parent, a Catholic who has
                                been confirmed, receives Communion and who lives a life of faith.
                            </p>
                        <p><b>What is the responsibility of the sponsor?</b></p>
                            <p>Since a sponsor has such a significant role to play in the development of the candidate
                                for Confirmation, it is important that this person be one who is a living example of
                                faith, one whose actions reflect the actions of Jesus. A Confirmation sponsor offers
                                support and encouragement during the Confirmation preparation process.
                            </p>
                            <p>During the Confirmation ceremony sponsors bring the candidates forward and present them
                                to the bishop.

                    <h2>Eucharist</h2>
                    <p>Eucharist is the sacrament that completes the process of initiation and is when one can fully
                        participate in the Eucharist by receiving Holy Communion. It is unique among the sacraments as
                        it is at the heart of our faith.
                    </p>
                    <p>For Catholics, the Eucharist, or Mass, is the most powerful way we encounter the real presence of
                        Jesus Christ. Sunday after Sunday (some, of course, gather everyday), Catholics gather to
                        celebrate the Eucharist, the ritual in which, by the power of the Holy Spirit, bread and wine
                        are transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ.
                    </p>
                    <p>We who celebrate are also transformed, becoming Christ’s presence to others, and recognising the
                        presence of Christ in others.

                    <h2>Penance</h2>
                    <p>The Sacrament of Penance is one of two sacraments of healing (the other being the Anointing of
                        the Sick). Penance is a sacrament of forgiveness and celebrates God’s love and mercy towards us.
                        It is about acknowledging and naming those times when we know we have done wrong, and then
                        making peace and restoring the relationships with those who have been affected by our poor
                        choices. The Sacrament of Penance is celebrated through the Rites of Reconciliation.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <p><b>What happens during Penance</b></p>
                    <p>Penance involves the individual acknowledging their sins and receiving the forgiveness of God
                        through the ministry of the priest.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through this process, a person is reconciled with the Church, renews his or her Baptism, and
                        continues to live as a disciple of Jesus.

                        <p><b>Why so many different names for the same sacrament?</b></p>
                            <p>The names emphasise different aspects of the sacrament.</p>
                            <p>Penance refers to our remorse, sorrow and resolution to amend our life with God’s help.
                                Confession refers to the act by which we tell our sins to the priest.
                            </p>
                            <p>Reconciliation refers to the goal of the celebration which is that sinners are reconciled
                                to God and the Church. The ritual is called the Sacrament of Penance, but is appropriate
                                to refer to it with any of these titles.
                            </p>
                        <p><b>What are the different ways that Reconciliation can occur?</b></p>
                            <p>There are three different forms that the Sacrament of Penance can take:</p>
                            <uL>
                                <li>
                                    <p>First form or Rite of Reconciliation is when we individually confess our sins to
                                        the priest.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Second form or Rite of Reconciliation is a celebration that occurs within the
                                        Church with the whole community and involves individual confession and
                                        absolution.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Third form or Rite of Reconciliation is also centred on the gathering of the
                                        community but is designed for situations where there is a grave necessity.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                        <p><b>Can a priest tell someone else about what they have heard in Confession?</b></p>
                            <p>When a person confesses their sins to a priest in the Sacrament of Penance, a very sacred
                                trust is formed. The priest must maintain absolute secrecy about anything that a person
                                confesses. This secrecy is called “the seal of confession”. Under no circumstances is
                                the priest allowed to break this sacred seal.

                        will receive. A sacrament is an outward sign established by Jesus Christ to confer inward grace.
                        In more basic terms, it is a rite that is performed to convey God’s grace to the recipient,
                        through the power of the Holy Spirit.

                        to be exercised in the Church until the end of time: thus it is the sacrament of apostolic

                    <h2>Becoming A Catholic</h2>
                    <p>The Catholic Church has a special way of initiating adults into the Catholic faith. It is
                        called the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA). It is a period of Christian formation
                        offered to those seeking to become Catholic. The RCIA may also be referred to as the
                        Catechumenate, highlighting its roots in the Christian formation of the early Church. The Rite
                        encompasses all aspects of the Christian life and includes an adaptation for children.
                    </p>
                    <p>The RCIA takes place within a parish community so you are able to share in the life of the Church
                        expressed in a local faith community. It offers a way to grow in knowledge of Christ and the
                        Catholic faith in company with others on a similar journey.
