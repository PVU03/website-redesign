                    <h2>Baptism</h2>
                    <p>Through Baptism we are given the privilege of being part of our Catholic community. In Baptism we
                        are given a share in God’s life Baptism incorporates us into the Body of Christ. Through the
                        waters of Baptism we have been liberated from the slavery of sin in order to live life to the
                        full. The outpouring of the Spirit at baptism enables us to bring Christ to the World.

                        <li><b>Baptism with Water</b>
                            <p>The water is a symbol of cleansing-washing away original sin. It is also a sign of
                                life-the new spiritual life that the baby or child is entering.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>The oil symbolises strengthening of faith in the challenges of life ahead-the sealing
                                with the Holy Spirit.
                            </p>

                        <li><b>White Garment</b>
                            <p>A baby or child is usually clothed in white or have a stole or white bib to symbolise
                                purity and innocence.

                <!-- Confirmation Information -->
                <div id="confirmation" class="content-item">
                    <h2>Confirmation</h2>
                    <p>The Sacrament of Confirmation is the second of the three sacraments of Christian initiation.
                        Confirmation completes Baptism, by which in the laying on of hands and the anointing with Chrism
                        Oil, which first happened at Baptism, we are confirmed with the fullness of the Holy Spirit. We
                        are reminded of our participation in the ministry and mission of Jesus, and strengthened to
                        follow Jesus more closely.
                    </p>
                    <p>Usually the bishop presides over this sacrament.</p>
                    <br>
                    <b>What happens during the sacrament of Confirmation?</b>
                    <p>The Sacrament of Confirmation consists of the renewal of baptismal promises and the laying on of
                        hands and anointing with the oil of Chrism. The anointing of the candidate is a sign of
                        confirming the gift of the Spirit, and calling the candidates to use these gifts to become
                        involved in the life and mission of the community.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>THE SYMBOLIC GESTURES OF CONFIRMATION</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The Laying On of Hands:</b>
                            <p>The bishop places his hands on the head of the candidates and prays for the gifts of the
                                Holy Spirit. This ritualises the connection to Baptism and the strengthening of the Holy
                                Spirit in our vocation to follow the way of Jesus.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Anointing with oil:</b>
                            <p>The anointing of the candidate at Confirmation recognises that they are sealed with the
                                Holy Spirit. The bishop anoints the candidate’s forehead with the Oil of Chrism, saying
                                ‘Be sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit’.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>The Sign of Peace:</b>
                            <p>At the end of the rite, the bishop puts his hand on the side of the candidate’s face and
                                says ‘Peace be with you’ and the candidate replies with ‘And with your spirit’,
                                symbolising the candidate’s place within the Church community.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>What do I need to do if I would like to have my child confirmed?</b>
                    <p>To start the process to be confirmed you will need to contact your local parish. We have
                        a contact page to help you contact our parish if you live in or near Cabramatta. Other than
                        that, if you would like to confirm your child, please fill in this form.
                    </p>
                    <p>Parents are the first teachers of faith to their children and therefore are required to take part
                        in the parish preparation to enable them to understand the meaning of the sacrament and the
                        commitment they will make to support their child’s growth in faith and life.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Eucharist</h2>
                    <p>Eucharist is the sacrament that completes the process of initiation and is when one can fully
                        participate in the Eucharist by receiving Holy Communion. It is unique among the sacraments as
                        it is at the heart of our faith.
                    </p>
                    <p>For Catholics, the Eucharist, or Mass, is the most powerful way we encounter the real presence of
                        Jesus Christ. Sunday after Sunday (some, of course, gather everyday), Catholics gather to
                        celebrate the Eucharist, the ritual in which, by the power of the Holy Spirit, bread and wine
                        are transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ.
                    </p>
                    <p>We who celebrate are also transformed, becoming Christ’s presence to others, and recognising the
                        presence of Christ in others.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Eucharist (Eucharist is a Greek word that means “thanksgiving”) is the whole ritual that has
                        come to be known as the Mass. The Eucharist is therefore a holy moment which includes the
                        consecration of the body and blood of Jesus.
